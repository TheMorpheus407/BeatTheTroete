# Beat the Tröte

## An AI that punishes players of Beat Saber for mistakes

### Idea
You want to get better at beat saber? Well why don't you just do the following:
- Step 1: Stream your Quest Gameplay to Browser
- Step 2: Record and train your AI based on the gameplay
- Step 3: Connect to a CtrlX of Bosch Rexroth and send a request to trigger a little motion, so a loud sound is given of the "Tröte"
- Step 4: Become an expert because you can't handle the loud "tröting"

### Should be done - but I will never do it
- Improve AI: It "tröts" when no game is played and in general does a lot of mistakes
  - I suggest not doing recognition based on images with CNNs but on videos with a RCNN.
- Improve the code quality

### Good Luck, Have fun
#### Oh, and go get yourself an appointment at the otologist *BEFORE* you play.
